## Completed user stories

  * Search results page
    * [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
    * [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
    * [x] Optional: Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
    * [x] Optional: infinite scroll for restaurant results
    * [x] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results
  * Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
    * [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
    * [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
    * [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. 
      * [x] Optional: implement a custom switch
    * [x] Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
    * [x] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list
    * [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
  * [x] Optional: Implement the restaurant detail page.
